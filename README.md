# node-mdaemon-api examples

## Goal

This repository has the sole purpose of collecting ECMAScript,
JavaScript, TypeScript scripts that can be used to solve small problems,
or to complete repetitive tasks in the management of MDaemon.

All scripts are not generic scripts, but use the native
[`node-mdaemon-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-mdaemon-api)
module that exposes a subset of MDaemon's native API to the Node.js
world.

> **WARNING**
>
> [`node-mdaemon-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-mdaemon-api)
> is not ready for production yet. Please, only install and use these
> scripts on Mdaemon test systems. Not on production systems.
